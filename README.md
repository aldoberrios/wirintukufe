# Wirintukufe
This is wirintukufe, a suite of R packages to work with text in Mapudungun, the Mapuche language.

# Motivation
The academic research of Mapudungun has steadily grown in the last two decades. The processing of text in Mapudungun has its difficulties due to competing standards and different types of research and methodologies. This suite of packages aims at easing those difficulties by proving functions in order to automate processes such as conversion from a text format into a phonetic writing based on the phonological descriptions available.

## Graphemizer
Convert text in Mapudungun between Mapuche alphabets. A grapheme transformation tool which converts text between the most popular alphabetic systems there are to write Mapudungun: Alfabeto mapuche unificado (Unified Mapuche Alphabet), Azümchefe alphabet and Raguileo alphabet.

## Phonemizer
Convert AMU text into IPA. An automatic phoneme transformation function, called phonemizer(), converts text written in Mapudungun into one of the several phonological descriptions for the language, allowing a variety of options that correspond to the different interpretations of the Mapuche phonemes, according to different phonological interpretation and dialect variants.

## Alphabetizer
Sort text using Unificado or Azümchefe order of characters. A sorting tool to sort into the idiosyncratic orders of the corresponding alphabets.

## Syllabizer
Separates IPA text in Mapudungun into syllables. A syllable parsing tool which segments at the syllable level a text written in the alphabetic system.

# Website end of this project
Two of the packages are available at online platforms.
